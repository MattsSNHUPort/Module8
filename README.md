Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
For this project I had to write code for 2 clocks. One clock would be a 24 hour clock and the other would be a 12 hour clock. I also had to write code that allowed the user to adjust the hour or minute by increasing it by 1 and then displaying it.

What did you do particularly well?
The way that I organized my program and minimized my main function worked very well. When I looked at the code after finishing I was very pleased with how organized it was and by how I did not crowd the main function.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
If I added a function to also remove 1 hour or 1 minute that would further my clocks funtionality. That would help if the user made a mistake and need to subtract a change they had just made. 

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The most challenging code to write in this was the functions. I had a difficult time trying to use the system clock and then manipulate it correctly. the way that I overcame this is to write a function that is in charge of displaying the clock and then seperate functions for each element I need to change. So these functions can pull values from the 12 hour and 24 hour functions and then change them so that the changes are reflected in each clock function. I used the ctime and windows.h to support this file. With ctime being used for the time and windows.h used to add the sleep function to the menu.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
Oranization is the big skill here that will be helpful in everything I write. By organzing my code and keeping it clean it helps with reading it and with the performance of the code. Also being able to use functions and call them in the main function is very useful as well. Both of these skills are basic and will be the building blocks for future projects.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
By orgazing my code I made it very readable. By adding in line comments I made it very maintable because everything is easy to follow and that allows for others to be able to come and change the values they need to make the program function as they desire. It is also very adaptable because it is all contained with in one file that can be called to by others if they needed to add a clock with functionality to a project.
